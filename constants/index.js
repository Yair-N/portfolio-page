    with React.js at the front-end and Node.js or Django at the backend,
    connecting with databases and other APIs.
    I'm constantly seeking new challenges and opportunities to grow,
    and I continue learn and expand my skills.`,

    me_2: `As a former Operations Manager with almost a decade of experience,
    I faced a wide variety of challenges while planning, organizing and 
    overseeing the supply chain of high quality components for the aerospace industry.
    from raw material, engineering, manufacturing, subcontractors and QA,
    to on-time delivery, I was responsible for managing several teams and ensuring 
    that all operations ran smoothly to produce timely delivery of high-quality results.
    I believe this experience has made me a well rounded person with a BIG passion for 
    problem solving.`,
